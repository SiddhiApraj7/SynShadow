# Overview
This subfolder is for putting various datasets.

Please at first download
- [Matte images](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RErNUbkstaiCchYzbe8wPYTEdU-Yp7o0/view?usp=drive_link) for SynShadow

**Note that these datasets are meant for education and research purposes only.**

## File Organization

### ISTD+/SRD+
```
- <dataset_name>
    - train
        - input
        - mask
        ( - target)  # only required for removal
    - test
        - input
        - mask
        ( - target)  # only required for removal
        ( - precomp_mask)  # precomputed shadow detection results, only required for SP+M in removal models
```

### USR
```
- USR
    - shadow_free
    - shadow_train
    - shadow_test
```

### SynShadow
Synthetic shadow images are generated on-the-fly during training using [this function](https://github.com/naoto0804/SynShadow/blob/main/src/util/illum_affine_model.py#L141-L155).

SynShadow dataset folder should be organized as follows:
```
- SynShadow
    - matte
    - shadow_free  # please copy or use symbolic link to get USR/shadow_free as shadow-free background images for shadow composition
```

        - [DHAN(AAAI2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08718) is providing masks extracted from shadow and shadow-free image pairs at [here](https://uofmacau-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/yb87432_umac_mo/EZ8CiIhNADlAkA4Fhim_QzgBfDeI7qdUrt6wv2EVxZSc2w?e=hZ0ruG)
        - We found that the original train-test split of SRD is inappropriate since images coming from the identical background are both in the training and testing set. We re-split SRD so that there is no overlap of scenes in the two sets and removed near-duplicate images. The new split is called SRD+, and we provide `SRD+_train.txt` and `SRD+_test.txt` for list of the images for SRD+.
